/**
 * Interface which defines methods for chromosome. Chromosome is a population unit used in genetic algorithms.
 * Chromosomes should be considered equal only if they are the same object. Otherwise, the genetic algorithms
 * implemented in {@link hr.dlatecki.algorithms.gen_alg} package may not work properly. Fitness of the chromosome is
 * determined by fitness tests. It is highly recommended not to directly implement this interface. Instead, extend the
 * <code>AbstractChromosome</code> class which already implements this interface and all of its methods.
